PROBLEM STATEMENT</b>
Indian roads are evident to 4 deaths every day (Source: sites.ndtv.com)
Over speeding and use of phones while driving has been a cause of a number of road
accidents. Smart phones provide a way of monitoring user activities and data on
physical location, altitudes, etc and mechanisms to help alert users by use of sound,
visuals and other effectors. Putting the technology available to better use to help reduce
such accidents may have a good impact on the lives of people and encourage them to
use such technologies.
